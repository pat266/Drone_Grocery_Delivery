# Drone Grocery Delivery

## CS4400 Group 6 Spring 2021
### Description
This is a project based on the description given in class. The project description states all information necessary for each role on every screen, and we would have to create a relational database to fulfill it.

### How it was made
I use JavaFX to design the front end and Java (connected to the MySQL Database by the Connector/J) for the back end. The database connected to this version is the Amazon RDS Free Tier of MySQL Community verison, so all changes and user registration can be seen by everyone else.

Install `mysql-connector-java-8.0.23` and `javafx-sdk-11.0.2` to compile the code.
