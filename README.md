### Description
This is a project based on the description given in class. The project description states all of the information necessary for each role on every screen, and we would have to create a relational database to fulfill it.
This repository only includes the .exe file of the program to avoid unnecessary problems from plagiarism since this is a project for a class.

### How it was made
I use JavaFX to design the front end and Java (connected to the MySQL Database by the Connector/J) for the back end. The database connected to this version is the Amazon RDS Free Tier of MySQL Community verison, so all users' changes can be seen by everyone else.
